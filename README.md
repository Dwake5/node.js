Node is a backend language written with JavaScript.

The course is 34.5 hours long, with frequent challenges and guides you through building 4 projects. 

App 1 is now built *note-app folder*
The user can add a note, remove a note, list all notes or read a note.

Function             Terminal command
Add:        node app.js add --title="(title of note)" --body="(main text of the note)" 
Remove:     node app.js remove --title"(title of note)"
List:       node app.js list 
Read:       node app.js read --title="(title of note)"
